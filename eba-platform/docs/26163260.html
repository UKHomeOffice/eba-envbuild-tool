An application is just a different specialisation of a component.  Ideally we would be able to apply the same logic to the changes we make to the environment management application so we can look towards arbitrary nesting.  This will be important as we expand it out to look at deploying different types of components.</li></ul></li><li>Update the environment-management program so that it:<ul><li>Takes a new command line argument ( an IPT Release Version ID)</li><li>Collects all of the ApplicationVersions for the IPT Release Version passed in</li><li>Generates a release deployment plan</li><li>Executes the release deployment plan</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Test Harness<ul><li>Update the test harness to cater for scenarios where we are deploying an IPT Release</li></ul></li></ul><p> </p><h2 id="Designnote-Environment&amp;ReleaseManagementV3.x-KeyFeaturesandDesignDecisions">Key Features and Design Decisions</h2><h3 id="Designnote-Environment&amp;ReleaseManagementV3.x-Extensibility,modularisationandprotectingstrategicusefulness">Extensibility, modularisation and protecting strategic usefulness</h3><p>The more we fit self service for a specific purpose the shorter we make its lifespan and the less useful we make it in the long term.  With every change we make we should be bearing in mind the effect that this change will have on the strategic usefulness of the tool.</p><p>Most of the changes that we are seeing now are add-on functionality rather than core functionality. </p><p>It is time to formalise the relationship between core self service functionality and add-on functionality.</p><h4 id="Designnote-Environment&amp;ReleaseManagementV3.x-SelfServicepluginAPI">Self Service plugin API</h4><p>Self Service needs to be updated to make use of a mechanism to extend its functionality through plugins.,  This will help us to stabilise the core codebase and extend outside of the main codebase.</p><p>Considerations for the design of plugins and their runtime environment are the following:</p><ul><li>Plugin authoring and deployment<br /><ul><li>Plugins should be developed in their own maven projects and separately deployable from the core application.  We may choose to bundle a set of known plugins for ease of deployment in the first instance.</li><li>Plugin projects should depend on the environment-management project and not the other way around</li><li>Where plugins are deployed bundled with the environment-management tooling they need to be bundled at the rpm stage so as not to introduce circular dependencies.</li><li>An abstract implementation of a plugin should be created which contains an empty implementation of all the interface methods as well as base code for loading configuration.

Regular, automatic Puppet runs will (in the vast majority of cases) ensure that the environments are synchronised with what resides in the Hiera repository.</p><p>However, in some cases due to a local Puppet issue or an RPM deployment issue, etc, this may not be case. Prior to a given self service deployment there may have been multiple Puppet runs that have silently failed and so the Hiera repository contains stale data.</p><p>A business need has therefore been identified that requires a feature to be added to an implementation of Self Service 3. This feature would enable a user to be warned in advance of a deployment when there is a mismatch between the RPMs defined in the Hiera repository and what is actually deployed in the environment (via YUM). The same business need would also apply to self service 2.</p><p>In it's first iteration, this feature would likely consist of extra information that is presented to user in the pre-deployment plan. This extra information would show not only Hiera's current view of the environment along with the target Hiera configuration, but crucially also what YUM is currently reporting as installed into the environment.</p><p>Future iterations of this feature could attempt to take remedial action in the case of a mismatch such as a preemptive Puppet run or editing the Hiera to reflect the environment (reverse synchronisation). This would likely need confirmation from the user before this is carried out.</p><h4 id="Designnote-Environment&amp;ReleaseManagementV3.x-Implementationnotes">Implementation notes</h4><p>The concept of a list of items deployed in an environment is a generic one of which a look at hiera or a look at yum are just examples.  I would like for us to extract out the common elements of both systems into a generic interface for fetching data about environments and versions of components deployed in the environments.  The code should then get data from both sources by accessing the same interface.</p><p>Moving in this direction will make it easier to move away from one or another  should we ever need to do so.</p><h3 id="Designnote-Environment&amp;ReleaseManagementV3.x-RPMFailFileReportingandRemoval">RPM Fail File Reporting and Removal</h3><p>When an RPM is deployed into an environment a pre-installation step is save an empty RPM 'fail file' into a specified directory. This fail file is then deleted upon successful installation. If an installation has been unsuccessful then the fail file would remain and would be detected by Puppet which would fail the overall Puppet run (and the wider self service job).</p><p>A feature has been included the latest self service 2 that will report the existence of fail files in an environment as part of the pre-deployment report. This feature would also be included in any implementation of self service 3.</p><p>A future iteration of this feature may also delete these files as part of a deployment. This should only be done once a user has confirmed that their existence has been investigated.</p><h3 id="Designnote-Environment&amp;ReleaseManagementV3.x-UIComplexity">UI Complexity</h3><p>Whilst the overall UX of self service 2 is good, it does suffer from an over abundance of logging. This leads to most users being left unable to interpret the logs when there are issues.</p><p>Both logging clarity and wider UX will have to be a key consideration for self service 3. The self service 3 deployment plan will have to handle the data associated with ten times the application deployments as self service 2.</p><h3 id="Designnote-Environment&amp;ReleaseManagementV3.x-DeploymentDescriptorComplexity">Deployment Descriptor Complexity</h3><p>Self service 2 DDs are inherently complex (many possible features) and this has lead to them being seen as opaque and hard to write &amp; understand.</p><p>Self service 3 DDs must be straightforward and for the most part should be easier to understand than self service 2 DDs as they really only define ordering.</p><h3 id="Designnote-Environment&amp;ReleaseManagementV3.x-Parallelism">Parallelism</h3><p>In service service 3 the deployment of some applications must be done in parallel to save time. This should be achieved by:</p><ol><li>Defining applications in the self service 3 deployment descriptor as being candidates for parallel deployment</li><li>Adding additional arguments to our MCollective calls to trigger Puppet runs simultaneously across an environment and for self service 3 to wait for all these to complete before continuing</li></ol><h3 id="Designnote-Environment&amp;ReleaseManagementV3.x-Waits">Waits</h3><p>In self service 3 some applications will require an arbitrary wait between application deployments. This is to allow for additional actions to finish that do not form part of the RPM installation.</p><p>This functionality would be defined in self service 3 deployment descriptor and/or release.</p><h3 id="Designnote-Environment&amp;ReleaseManagementV3.x-Auditingandreportingofdeployments">Auditing and reporting of deployments</h3><p>All self service 3 deployments must be recorded in the release database to ensure reporting, auditing and repeated deployments can be carried out. </p><h3 id="Designnote-Environment&amp;ReleaseManagementV3.x-Ad-hoc&#39;Custom&#39;Deployments-NOTIMPLEMENTED">Ad-hoc 'Custom' Deployments - NOT IMPLEMENTED</h3><p>A business need has been reported to allow a subgroup of privileged users to carry out self service 3 deployments that are involve only a subset of applications. This would likely be carried out mid-sprint hotfix or when a previously deployment failed.</p><p>The standard self service 3 release process, along with custom releases, is detailed below.</p><p>
