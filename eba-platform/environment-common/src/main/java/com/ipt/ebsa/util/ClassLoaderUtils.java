	 * Ooh this is nasty.
	 * The version of hibernates antlr library conflicts with the version of the antlr library that jenkins uses.
	 * It only happens when I use the "IN" syntax in queries which is what happens when I fetch the component versions (below)
	 * The classloader shenanigans below are there to make sure that it is the antlr library that I supplied 
	 * that is used and not the one that jenkins supplies. 
	 * I would really like to know how jenkins does its classloader instantiation.  Ideally it would be the plugins classes
	 * which are loaded first.  This will have to do for now....technical debt.
