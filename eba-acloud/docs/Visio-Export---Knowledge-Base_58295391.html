It's also worth manually going through the XML file to make sure that there aren't any other similar shapes that are being ignored by the Visio.</td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>In some cases the Network Interfaces in the XML are pointing to the wrong type of Network. Normally a VM would have 2 NICs. One of them would point to the Management network, the other to the Application Network. However there have been cases where both of the NICs would point to the Management network even though it appears that it's connected to the Application network.</p><p><span><img class="emoticon emoticon-tick" src="images/icons/emoticons/check.png" data-emoticon-name="tick" alt="(tick)"/> This is no longer an issue in the new version (re-write).</span></p></td><td class="confluenceTd">This is because when the connection point (snap point) was created, the wrong network was selected and even though it appears that you're attaching the connection point to the right network, actually you are creating a connection point for the shape that you have currently selected. The solution is to simply delete the connection point (Shift+Ctrl+1), to select the correct network and to re-create the connection point. Do not forget to re-attach the NIC to the newly created connection point.</td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Some of the VMs in a cluster/pair would have different specification even though they're grouped together.</p><p><img class="emoticon emoticon-tick" src="images/icons/emoticons/check.png" data-emoticon-name="tick" alt="(tick)"/> This is no longer an issue in the new version (re-write).</p></td><td class="confluenceTd">This is because the data has been explicitly specified on the other layers in the group. This would then require that all of the layers (virtual machines) in the group are updated with the same information. To avoid this issue, only fill out the top layer (first virtual machine) that you can clearly see in the group and leave the rest of them blank. The code should be able to retrieve all the information it needs from that first shape and apply it to the rest of them.</td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd">The changes made to the shape (Virtual Machine/NIC/Network) do not reflect in the XML.</td><td class="confluenceTd">This could be because only the actual label (text on the shape) was modified and not the actual data sheet that contains all of the properties. When making changes make sure to modify the data sheet first and only change the label afterwards if necessary (in most cases the label will update itself when the data sheet is changed).</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" class="confluenceTd">Version number of the XML is lower than the one currently in the repository.</td><td colspan="1" class="confluenceTd">This could be because when the previous export was made, the person who carried it out did not commit their design .vsd file to the repository. Also it's worth mentioning that you should ensure that you sync all of the files before making any changes as Git is unable to merge .vsd changes (as it is not in plain text format), meaning that only one person should be modifying the design at a time.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
